[4chanX](https://github.com/ccd0/4chan-x)
## Installing
[Install OurGirl](https://github.com/ti2782/OurGirl/raw/master/ourgirl.user.js)
## Description
Adds a button to every post on 4chan that automatically copies the post to your clipboard in the required formatting for /ourgirl/ to understand it. Then opens a new tab pointing towards [/OurGirl/'s Webinterface](https://talktotransformer.com). Simply press 'ctrl + v' to paste it and then generate your answer.


You've got to format the input text like a 4chan thread so the output will show her segmented thought process.
Otherwise She'll just finish the sentence in a mundane manner. The 4chan format makes it possible to have extended "conversations". Especially if you adjust the thread No. count accordingly in each iteration. By doing this you see that she is capable of referencing previous inputs.
